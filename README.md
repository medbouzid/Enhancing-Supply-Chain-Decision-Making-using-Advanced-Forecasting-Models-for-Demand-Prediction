This repository contains the code and analysis Store Item Demand Forecasting Using Different Models

## Overview 
Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for supply chain management. This research explores advanced forecasting models like XGBoost, ARIMA, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM. The study uses sales data for 50 items across 10 retailers over five years, evaluating the effectiveness of these models and emphasizing the suitability of each.

## Key Features
In-depth analysis of a five-year dataset with sales information for 50 products across 10 locations.
Evaluation of advanced forecasting models and their suitability for diverse data characteristics.
Performance comparison using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

## Models Explored
**ARIMA**: Versatile and simple, suitable for data with patterns.
**Linear Regression**: Predicts based on relationships between features and demand.
**Random Forest**: Effective for diverse prediction scenarios with both numerical and categorical data.
**XGBoost**: Portable, adaptable, and efficient, suitable for data with categorical features.
**LSTM**: Effective for data showing temporal dependencies, especially in time series forecasting.

## Dataset
Sales data for 50 items across 10 stores from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017.
913,000 observations with features: date, store, item, and sales.

## Analysis Highlights
Graphical examination of trends, seasonality, and residuals.
Transformation techniques applied to address non-stationarity.

## Results and Comparison
LSTM and ARIMA exhibit the highest accuracy among the models.
Comparative analysis using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared scores.

The research emphasizes on the benefits of precise demand forecasting in mitigating risks, optimizing inventory, and enhancing overall supply chain efficiency.
